Question 1 
  You are creating a class named MyNamespace.SpecificNamespace.Class2. Which of the following classes could your new class inherit from? [Select all correct answers.]
 
    
 A)  Microsoft.Windows.Forms.Control
 
 B)  MyNamespace.Class1
 
 C)  MyNamespace.SpecificNamespace.Class1
 
 D)  MyNamespace.SpecificNamespace.Class2
 
 
Explanation


Answers A, B, and C are correct. Although the namespace hierarchy is used in order to organize the various classes within a project, this hierarchy is independent from the chain of inheritance. A class may inherit from any other class throughout the namespace hierarchy. However, answer D is incorrect because a class cannot inherit from itself.


Question 2 
  How should you arrange Catch blocks?
 
    
 A)  Only one Catch block for each Try code block, located after the Try code block but before the End Try statement.
 
 B)  Several Catch blocks within one Try code block, arranged starting with Exception and ending with the most specific exception.
 
 C)  Several Catch blocks within one Try code block, arranged starting with the most specific exception and ending with Exception.
 
 D)  Catch blocks should be used only when a Finally block is not used.
 
 

Explanation


Answer C is correct. One or more Catch blocks may be used with a Try code block, arranged in order from the most specific exception to the most general because the first match will be used for evaluation. Answer A is incorrect because you may associate more than one Catch block with a Try block. Answer B is incorrect because it specifies a reversed order, starting with Exception. Nothing would ever be evaluated past the first Catch block, because Exception includes all other more-specific exceptions. Answer D is incorrect because Catch and Finally blocks may both be used if desired.


Question 3 
  What is the default data binding behavior when you add a new control to a Windows form?
 
    
 A)  The control is not bound to any data source.
 
 B)  The control is bound to the data source available through the first CurrencyManager object on the form.
 
 C)  The control is bound to the data source available through the most recent CurrencyManager object on the form.
 
 D)  The control adds a new CurrencyManager object to the default BindingContext object on the form.
 
 
Explanation


Answer A is correct. By default, controls on a Windows form are not data bound. Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because they all specify a default data binding. While you can use any of these data binding strategies in code, it's up to you to decide which data binding you would like for a particular control.


Question 4 
  You're developing a Windows Forms application that enables users to generate shipping labels. The program needs to generate thousands of shipping labels each day. You use the Trace object to monitor the application and log the results in the Windows Event Log. You need to monitor errors, warnings, and other informational messages generated by the Trace object. You should have flexibility in controlling the amount of information logged for your application, and you want to do this with minimal administrative effort. What should you do?
 
    
 A)  Start the application using the /d:TRACE switch.
 
 B)  Define an environment variable named TRACE and set its value to True or False. In the program, check the value of the environment variable to indicate the amount of information you want to be logged for your application.
 
 C)  Declare a compilation constant named TRACE and set its value to Error, Warning, or Info. In your program use #If, #Else, and #Endif directives to check for the level of tracing you want.
 
 D)  Use the TraceSwitch class in your program and use the TraceSwitch.Level property to check whether you need to log the performance. Set the level of the TraceSwitch by using the application's configuration file.
 
   
 
Explanation


Answer D is correct. The TraceSwitch class provides a multilevel switch to control tracing output without recompiling your code. Answer A is incorrect because the /d:TRACE option just enables tracing. It does not allow multilevel control over tracing output. Answer B is incorrect because modifying environmental variables requires much more administrative effort when compared to using a configuration file. Answer C is incorrect because this option requires the program to be recompiled each time the value of TRACE is modified.


Question 5 
  Your form allows the user to enter a telephone number into a TextBox control named txtPhone. You use the Validating event of this control to check whether the phone number is in the correct format. If the phone number is not in the correct format, you do not allow the focus to leave the txtPhone TextBox control.

The form also includes a Button control called btnCancel for canceling the data-entry action. The user should be able to click this button at any time, even when there is invalid data in the text box. What would you do to ensure this?
 
    
 A)  Set the CausesValidation property of the TextBox control to True.
 
 B)  Set the CausesValidation property of the Button control to True.
 
 C)  Set the CausesValidation property of the TextBox control to False.
 
 D)  Set the CausesValidation property of the Button control to False.
 
 
Explanation


Answer D is correct. You should set the CausesValidation property of the Button control to False because this causes the Validating event of other controls to be ignored when the focus is shifted to the specified control. Answers A and C are incorrect because setting the CausesValidation property of a TextBox control will not have any effect on the Button control. Answer B is incorrect because setting the CausesValidation property of the Button control to True will not allow the user to click the button when there is invalid data in the text box.


Question 6 
  Your application retrieves data from the Customers and Orders tables in a database by using a view named vwCustOrders. This view is used as the CommandText for the SelectCommand of a DataAdapter object. The application uses the Fill() method of this DataAdapter to fill a DataSet. The DataSet is bound to a DataGrid control.

Users report that changes they make to data displayed on the DataGrid control are not saved to the database. What could be the problem?
 
    
 A)  The DataGrid control does not support editing data from a database.
 
 B)  You cannot update a DataSet that's based on a view.
 
 C)  The DataGrid control does not support two-way data binding.
 
 D)  Your application does not call the Update() method of the DataAdapter object.
 
   
 
Explanation


Answer D is correct. Changes made to a DataGrid control that's bound to a DataSet are automatically saved to the DataSet. However, these changes are not updated to the underlying data source until you call the Update method of the DataAdapter object that was used to fill the DataSet. Answers A and C are incorrect because the DataGrid control does support editing the data from a database and two-way data binding. Answer B is incorrect because a DataSet, which is based on a view, can be updated.


Question 7 
  You are writing a Visual Basic .NET Windows application that executes several stored procedures to update a SQL Server database. You use database transactions to ensure that either all updates to the database succeed or the changes are rolled back in case of an error. You used the following code segment to create the database connection and the transaction object in your program:

Dim sqlConnection1 As SqlConnection = _
            New SqlConnection(strConnString)
sqlConnection1.Open()

Dim sqlCommand1 As SqlCommand = New SqlCommand()
Dim sqlTrans As SqlTransaction
You need to prevent other users from updating or inserting rows into the database until the transaction is complete. Which one of the following statements enable you to fulfill this requirement?
 
    
 A)  sqlTrans = sqlConnection1.BeginTransaction( _
   IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted)
 
 B)  sqlTrans = sqlConnection1.BeginTransaction( _
    IsolationLevel.Serializable)
 
 C)  sqlTrans = sqlCommand1.BeginTransaction( _
   IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted)
 
 D)  sqlTrans = sqlCommand1.BeginTransaction( _
    IsolationLevel.Serializable)
 
 
Explanation


Answer B is correct. IsolationLevel.Serializable places a range lock on the database, preventing other users from updating or inserting rows into the database until the transaction is complete. Answer A is incorrect because IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted holds the lock while the data is being read, but data can be changed before the transaction is complete. Answers C and D are incorrect because the BeginTransaction method is available for objects of the SqlConnection type but is not available for objects of the SqlCommand type.


Question 8 
  You have designed a Windows application that will help users plan, manage, and file their income taxes. Because this market is competitive, you want to list the application in the Microsoft Windows catalog. Which of the following requirements must the application satisfy in order to be listed in the Windows catalog? [Select all that apply.]
 
    
 A)  Install to Program Files by default.
 
 B)  Properly support Add/Remove Programs.
 
 C)  Support AutoPlay for CDs and DVDs.
 
 D)  Fix all known bugs in the software.
 
 
Explanation


Answers are A, B, and C are correct. To be listed in the Windows catalog, an application must meet the requirements mentioned in the specifications of the Windows logo program. Answer D is incorrect because you are not required to fix all known bugs to be listed in the Windows catalog.


Question 9 
  Which of the following are valid transport protocols for translated XML messages? [Select all that apply.]
 
    
 A)  FTP
 
 B)  HTTP
 
 C)  SOAP
 
 D)  SMTP
 
 
Answers A, B, and D are correct. SOAP-translated XML messages may be transported using the FTP, HTTP, and SMTP, protocols. Answer C is incorrect because SOAP is used to encapsulate objects into XML format but does not provide a transport mechanism.


Question 10 
  You have a TextBox control and a help button that the user can click to get help on allowable values. You validate the data entered by the user in the TextBox control, and if the user enters an invalid value you set the focus back in the control using the Cancel property of CancelEventArgs. A user reports that once he enters invalid data in the text box, he cannot click the help button. What should you do to correct the problem?
 
    
 A)  Set the CausesValidation property of the text box to False
 
 B)  Set the CausesValidation property of the text box to True
 
 C)  Set the CausesValidation property of the help button to False
 
 D)  Set the CausesValidation property of the help button to True
 
   
Explanation


Answer C is correct. By setting the CausesValidation property of the help button to False, you allow it to act without first firing the Validating event in the text box, which would return the focus to the text box. Answers A and B are incorrect because changing the CausesValidation property of the text box will not affect the ability of the help button to be selected. Answer D is incorrect because setting the CausesValidation property of the help button to True (the default value) would result in the same problem experienced by the user.


Question 11 
  You have created the file NewService.asmx containing code for a new Web service named MyService. The code contains the exposed methods FirstService and SecondService. In order to expose the FirstService method, which of the following must be done to the method?
 
    
 A)  Configure NewService.asmx for anonymous access.
 
 B)  Configure MyService using the attribute.
 
 C)  Configure FirstService using the attribute.
 
 D)  Configure FirstService using the attribute.
 
 
Explanation


Answer C is correct. The FirstService method must be marked using the attribute in order to expose it within the Web service. Answers A and B are incorrect because the exposure of methods is not performed at the file or class level. Answer D is incorrect because the attribute is used to mark an exposed class.


Question 12 
  You have designed a custom user control combining five TextBox controls and two Button controls. You do not want the client application to be able to access the contained objects within your control. Which modifiers should you use to achieve this requirement? [Select all correct answers.]
 
    
 A)  Private
 
 B)  Friend
 
 C)  Protected
 
 D)  Public
 
 
  
Explanation


Answers A and B are correct. When you configure the contained objects within a control as Friend or Private, they are not accessible to the client application for direct manipulation. Answer C is incorrect because the Protected setting only limits access to the same project, and Answer D is incorrect because Public assignment allows access from any solution.

 
  
Question 13 
  You are designing a component that interacts with the computers in a network. The component has no visual representation but should provide you a design-time interface that will help client application designers to set its properties and behavior. Which of the following should you chose as the base class for this control?
 
    
 A)  System.Windows.Forms.Control
 
 B)  System.Windows.Forms.UserControl
 
 C)  System.Windows.Forms.Form
 
 D)  System.ComponentModel.Component
 
 
Explanation


Answer D is correct. Components that provide no visual interface should derive directly from the System.ComponentModel.Component class. Answers A and B are incorrect because the Control and UserControl classes are used for components needing a visual representation. Answer C is incorrect because a Form class is used as a container for other controls and includes a visual representation.


Question 14 
  You are invoking a Web service within your client application. This Web service returns the DataSet object, which is included in the System.Data namespace. Where should you place a reference to the namespace?
 
    
 A)  In the client application project only.
 
 B)  In the Web service project only.
 
 C)  In both the client application and Web service projects.
 
 D)  You do not need to specify the namespace reference in either project.
 
 
Explanation


Answer C is correct. You must place a reference to the proper namespace in both projects in order to generate and access a DataSet object between the server and client applications. Answers A and B are both incorrect because they specify only one of the two requirements, whereas answer D fails to include either.


Question 15 
  You've developed a Windows-based application that retrieves data from a SQL Server database named Customers. You use the System.Data.SqlClient data provider to connect with the database. You need to log the severity level of the error returned from the SQL Server .NET data provider. Which of the following options should you choose?
 
    
 A)  Catch the SqlException thrown by the SQL Server .NET data provider. Examine the Class property of the SqlException object.
 
 B)  Catch the SqlException thrown by the SQL Server .NET data provider. Examine the Source property of the SqlException object.
 
 C)  Catch the SqlException thrown by the SQL Server .NET data provider. Examine the Server property of the SqlException object.
 
 D)  Catch the SqlException thrown by the SQL Server .NET data provider. Examine the State property of the SqlException object.
 
 
Explanation


Answer A is correct. The SqlException.Class property gets a value from 1 to 25 that indicates the severity level of the error. Answer B is incorrect because the SqlException.Source property gets the name of the provider that generated the error. Answer C is incorrect because the SqlException.Server property gets the name of the computer running an instance of SQL Server that generated the error. Answer D is incorrect because the SqlException.State property gets a numeric error code from SQL Server that represents an error, warning, or "no data found" message.


Question 16 
  Which keyword declares a constructor in Visual Basic .NET?
 
    
 A)  The Get keyword
 
 B)  The Set keyword
 
 C)  The New keyword
 
 D)  The Show keyword
 
 
Explanation


Answer C is correct. The New keyword is used to indicate the constructor of a class, which is called to create a new instance of the class. The Get and Set keywords are used in property procedures, to read and write the values of properties. The Show method is used to display a form on screen. Therefore, answers a, b, and d are all incorrect


Question 17 
  You are using the classes in the System.Drawing namespace to render your company's logo to a Windows form. You wish to ensure that the small text in the logo is as clear as possible. Which member of the SmoothingMode enumeration should you use in your code?
 
    
 A)  AntiAlias
 
 B)  Default
 
 C)  HighSpeed
 
 D)  None
 
 
Explanation


Answer A is correct. If you use SmoothingMode.AntiAlias (or SmoothingMode.HighQuality), text will be antialiased. When antialiasing is used, two bordering colors are overlaid by semitransparent pixels of the opposing type, generating a smooth-appearing transition rather than a sharp, pixelated border. Answers B is incorrect because antialiasing is off by default. Answer C is incorrect because high-speed drawing is done without antialiasing. Answer D is incorrect because antialiasing will not be performed unless you specifically request it.


Question 18 
  Your form includes two TextBox controls and one ComboBox control. You want to include pop-up textual descriptions of your form's controls when users pass their mouse cursors over them. How many ToolTip components should you place on your form to meet this requirement?
 
    
 A)  None
 
 B)  One
 
 C)  Two
 
 D)  Three
 
 

Explanation


Answer B is correct. You only need to place a single ToolTip component on your form. This component will extend the properties of all controls on the form to include support for ToolTip text.

Question 19 
  You need to develop a graphics application using Visual Basic .NET. Your application needs to draw images on the screen, and you are looking for a solution that gives you the best performance. You have created several variations of a method that draws an image. Which of the following variations would you choose for your application?
 
    
 A)  Public Sub DrawSampleImage(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs )
    Dim newImage As Image = Image.FromFile("SampImag.jpg")
    Dim ulCorner As Point = New Point(100, 100)
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(newImage, ulCorner)
End Sub
 
 B)  Public Sub DrawSampleImage(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)
    Dim newImage As Image = Image.FromFile("SampImag.jpg")
    Dim x As Integer = 100
    Dim y As Integer = 100
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(newImage, x, y)
End Sub
 
 C)  Public Sub DrawSampleImage(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)
    Dim newImage As Image = Image.FromFile("SampImag.jpg")
    Dim destRect As Rectangle = _
        New Rectangle(100, 100, 450, 150)
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(newImage, destRect)
End Sub
 
 D)  Public Sub DrawSampleImage(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs)
    Dim newImage As Image = Image.FromFile("SampImag.jpg")
    Dim x As Double = 100.0F
    Dim y As Double = 100.0F
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(newImage, x, y)
End Sub
 
 
Explanation


Answer C is correct. This variation gives the best performance because it specifies the destination size of the image, thereby avoiding any autoscaling of the image. Answer A, B, and D are incorrect because in the absence of the information about the destination size of the image, the DrawImage method needs to perform extra processing. Therefore, the image is drawn slowly.


Question 20 
  Your corporate guidelines insist that the documents generated by programs should be printed on legal-sized paper. Unfortunately, users sometimes use the Printer Setup dialog box to switch to letter-sized paper for their own convenience. Which event of the PrintDocument class can you use to check and (if necessary) change the paper tray?
 
    
 A)  BeginPrint
 
 B)  BeginPrint
 
 C)  PrintPage
 
 D)  QueryPageSettings
 
 
Explanation


Answer D is correct. The QueryPageSettings event fires before each page is printed and allows you to check and change page settings. Answers A and B are incorrect because you do not have access to the PageSettings objects in the event arguments of the BeginPrint and EndPrint events. Answer C is incorrect because the event arguments of the PrintPage event provide read-only access to the PageSettings objects.

 
  
Question 21 
  Which of the following properties can be specified at runtime by using a dynamic property? [Select all correct answers.]
 
    
 A)  Text
 
 B)  ShowInTaskBar
 
 C)  Enabled
 
 D)  ReadOnly
 
 
Explanation


Answers A, B, C, and D are correct. You can use dynamic properties to set any property at runtime


Question 22 
  How should you redirect calls from one version of an assembly to a newer version of the same assembly?
 
    
 A)  Change the application that calls the assembly to reference the newer version.
 
 B)  Use the Microsoft .NET Framework Configuration tool to create a configured assembly that will redirect the calls.
 
 C)  Replace the old version of the assembly with the new version of the assembly.
 
 D)  Install the new version of the assembly alongside the old version of the assembly
 
 
Explanation


Answer B is correct. By creating a configured assembly, you can redirect calls to one version of an assembly to a different version. Answer A is incorrect because there's no need to change all the calling applications. Answers C and D are incorrect because .NET applications will by default only call the version of an assembly that they were created with, even if a newer version of the assembly is available.

Question 23 
  The framework class library (FCL) includes which of the following?
 
    
 A)  Custom classes created by a particular developer
 
 B)  Custom classes shared by a particular project
 
 C)  Public classes common to the .NET Framework
 
 D)  Private classes common to the .NET Framework
 
 
Explanation


Answer C is correct. The FCL includes hundreds of public classes that may be used in an application developed within the .NET Framework. Answers A and B are incorrect because the FCL contains classes common to the .NET Framework rather than custom user-created classes. Answer D is incorrect because the classes within the FCL are public rather than private.


Question 24 
  You are designing a culture-aware application that must reconfigure the user interface for different locales. Which property should you set to ensure correct formatting of currency and numbers in this application?
 
    
 A)  CurrentCulture
 
 B)  CurrentUICulture
 
 C)  RightToLeft
 
 D)  Text
 
 
Explanation


Answer A is correct. The CurrentCulture property dictates the formatting to be applied to items such as numbers and currency. Answer B is incorrect because the CurrentUICulture property tells the CLR which culture to use when selecting resource files for the user interface itself. Answer C is incorrect because the RightToLeft property controls the direction of text rendering, not its content. Answer D is incorrect because setting the Text property does not provide automatic localization.


Question 25 
  Which of the following are reasons for using legacy code within .NET applications? [Select all that apply.]
 
    
 A)  Other developers may be continuing to develop COM and ActiveX elements.
 
 B)  Third-party components may use older technologies.
 
 C)  COM+ components may be faster than their .NET equivalents.
 
 D)  It is possible to migrate in stages.
 
 
Explanation


Answers A, B, and D are correct. The ability to use legacy components in your .NET applications allows you to begin a staged migration while other developers continue using technologies they are more familiar with as well as to support third-party–provided components. Answer C is incorrect because the use of the proxy wrapper between .NET code and encapsulated COM or COM+ components will generally cause legacy components to suffer a performance penalty compared to .NET components running within the CLR.


Question 26 
  Which of the following can you access through code? [Select all correct answers.]
 
    
 A)  Static properties of a class
 
 B)  Nonstatic properties of a class
 
 C)  Properties of an instance
 
 D)  Methods of an instance
 
 
Explanation


Answers A, C, and D are correct. Answer B is incorrect because a class is an abstract concept grouping properties and methods that may be used by an instance of the class. If the class is not instantiated, it cannot be directly accessed. Only static members (answer A) can be used without instantiating the class. If you instantiate the class, you have full access to its methods and properties. Therefore, answers C and D are correct.


Question 27 
  You are developing a Windows-based application using Visual Basic .NET. Your application's configuration files have the following code:

&lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
    &lt;switches&gt;
        &lt;add name="TraceLevelSwitch" value="3" /&gt;
    &lt;/switches&gt;
&lt;/system.diagnostics&gt;
You have written the following tracing code in your program:

Dim ts As TraceSwitch = New TraceSwitch( _
 "TraceLevelSwitch", "Trace the application")

&lt;Conditional("DEBUG")&gt; _
Private Sub Method1()
    Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceError, _
     "Message 1", "Message 2")
End Sub

&lt;Conditional("TRACE")&gt; _
Private Sub Method2()
    Trace.WriteLine("Message 3")
End Sub

Private Sub btnCalculate_Click( _
 ByVal sender As System.Object, _
 ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnCalculate.Click
    If ts.TraceWarning Then
        Trace.WriteLine("Message 10")
        Method1()
    Else
        Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceInfo, "Message 20")
        Method2()
    End If

    If (ts.TraceError) Then
        Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceInfo, "Message 30")
        Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceVerbose, "Message 40")
    End If
End Sub
What tracing output will be generated when you run your program in debug mode and click the btnCalculate button?
 
    
 A)  Message 10
Message 1
Message 2
Message 30
 
 B)  Message 10
Message 2: Message 1
Message 30
 
 C)  Message 10
Message 2
Message 30
Message 40
 
 D)  Message 20
Message 3
Message 30
Message 40
 
 
Explanation


Answer B is correct. The XML file has the value 3 for TraceLevelSwitch, which sets the Level property as TraceLevel.Info. Answers A, C and D are incorrect because setting the Level property as TraceLevel.Info will cause the TraceError, TraceWarning, and TraceInfo properties of the traceSwitch to be True. Only the TraceVerbose property will evaluate to False. Also, the third parameter to the WriteLineIf method is used to categorize the output by placing its value followed by a colon (:) and then the trace message.


Question 28 
  You've developed a Windows-based application using Visual Studio .NET. The application needs to be distributed to users via the Internet. You use Visual Studio .NET Setup and Deployment projects to package the application. When you test the software on a Windows XP machine, you observe that your name is being shown as software publisher in the program-support information in the Add and Remove Programs section of the Windows Controls Panel. You need to change the name so that your company's name is displayed in the support information instead of yours. Which of the following procedures of the deployment project should you change?
 
    
 A)  Author
 
 B)  Description
 
 C)  SupportPhone
 
 D)  SupportUrl
 
 
Explanation


Answer A is correct. You need to change the Author property of the deployment project because the Author property specifies the name of the application's author. Answer B is incorrect because the Description property is usually used to describe the application instead of to specify the name of the publisher. Answers C and D are incorrect because they are intended to specify the phone number and the URL of the manufacturer instead of the name.


Question 29 
  You are creating an application that will be used companywide. Several forms show a clock to the user. You decide to code the custom analog clock as a reusable component. Which of the following classes should be the base class for creating this control?
 
    
 A)  System.Windows.Forms.Control
 
 B)  System.Windows.Forms.UserControl
 
 C)  System.Windows.Forms.Form
 
 D)  System.ComponentModel
 
 
Explanation


Answer A is correct. You should inherit from the Control class if you want to provide a custom graphical representation of your control or functionality that is not available through standard controls. Answer B is incorrect because the UserControl class provides the capability to quickly create a reusable component by combining existing Windows controls. Answer C is incorrect because you would not use a form within another form as a control. Answer D is incorrect because the base Component class is extended to create nonvisual components.


Question 30 
  Your department is responsible for maintaining a variety of accounting applications. You've been assigned the task of creating a standard control to represent credit and debit accounts. The control will be made up of a collection of TextBox and ComboBox controls. You want to write minimum code. On which class should you base this control?
 
    
 A)  Control
 
 B)  UserControl
 
 C)  Form
 
 D)  Component
 
 
Explanation


Answer B is correct. The UserControl class provides you with a design surface on which you can assemble constituent controls to create a custom control. Answer A is incorrect because it requires you to write additional code. Answer C is incorrect because deriving from the Form class is not a standard way to create reusable controls. Answer D is incorrect because using the Component class to create reusable visual components requires additional programming and is therefore better suited for creating nonvisual components.
