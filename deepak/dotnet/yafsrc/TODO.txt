- Approved users don't have to be moderated
- Is there currently a way to display a welcome message / header 
  specific to certain groups? For instance, I would like to display 
  a message to all Guests encouraging them to register on the site, 
  however, I do not want this message visible to Members or Administrators.
- It would be nice to have a Popup + Web + EMail notification for Personal 
  Messages + an option in the Profile to disable it.
- tooltips for user profile links (View profile).
- somehow show that there are messages to be moderated.
- Keep deleted posts for later purge. Option for moderators to tell why the post was deleted.
- Admin can change user password
- Language strings: tooltips for buttons (reply, quote, ...)
- Censoring: <http://forum.yetanotherforum.net/posts.aspx?t=339>
- Unicode support: <http://forum.yetanotherforum.net/default.aspx?g=posts&m=1036#1036>
- Limit sigs to 5 lines or something...
- Link correctly back to forum from install.
- Anonymous login
- In the list of topics of a forum, can be showed a different image for topics 
  with most activity then other (more than 10 or configurable numbers of posts).
- A fast response text box (only simple text with post button) at the bottom of 
  an open topic if the user can reply. So if I read a topic and want to reply 
  "on the fly" I can do it immediatly.
- Fix translation again for richedit.
- Add colors to rich editor.
- Ok this is what i get after i try to add a sub forum.... "User 'pro-logic' isn't registered."
- Possible to modify subject of messages?!?
- Disable user registration.
- "New posts" icons should also check sub-forums.
- Forum dropdowns: http://forum.yetanotherforum.net/default.aspx?g=posts&t=474&find=unread
- Error deleting posts with attachments.
