Operators are used to operate on values.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arithmetic Operators
Operator Description Example Result 
+ 	Addition  
	x=2
	x+2  	4  
- 	Subtraction  
	x=2
	5-x  	3  
* 	Multiplication  
	x=4
	x*5 	20  
/ 	Division  
	15/5	3
	5/2  	2.5 
% 	Modulus (division remainder)  
	5%2	1
	10%8	2
	10%2	0
 
++ 	Increment 
	x=5
	x++ 	 x=6  

-- 	Decrement 
	x=5
	x--  	x=4  

Assignment Operators
Operator Example Is The Same As 
	= 	x=y 	x=y 
	+= 	x+=y  	x=x+y  
	-= 	x-=y  	x=x-y  
	*= 	x*=y  	x=x*y  
	/= 	x/=y  	x=x/y 
	%= 	x%=y  	x=x%y 

Comparison Operators
Operator Description Example 
	== is equal to  	5==8 	returns false  
	!= is not equal  	5!=8 	returns true  
	> is greater than  	5>8 	returns false  
	< is less than  	5<8 	returns true 
	>= is greater than or equal to  
			5>=8 	returns false 
	<= is less than or equal to  
			5<=8 	returns true 

Logical Operators
Operator Description Example 
	&& 	and  
	x=6	y=3 
	    (x < 10 && y > 1) returns true
 
	|| 	or  	
	x=6	y=3
	(x==5 || y==5) returns false
 
	! 	not  	
	x=6	y=3 
	!(x==y) returns true
 

String Operator
A string is most often text, for example "Hello World!". To stick two or more string variables together, 
use the + operator.

	txt1="What a very"
	txt2="nice day!"
	
	txt3=txt1+ "   " + txt2 
 

The variable txt3 now contains "What a verynice day!".

To add a space between two string variables, insert a space into the expression, OR in one of the strings.

txt1="What a very"
txt2="nice day!"
txt3=txt1+" "+txt2
or
txt1="What a very "
txt2="nice day!"
txt3=txt1+txt2
 

The variable txt3 now contains "What a very nice day!".


Conditional Operator
JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.

Syntax
variablename=(condition)?value1 :  value2 
 

Example
val =  (visitor=="PRES")?"Dear President ":"Dear "
