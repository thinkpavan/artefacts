Scripts in the BODY section will be executed WHILE the page loads.

Scripts in the HEAD section will be executed when CALLED.


Head section
Scripts that contain functions go in the head section of the document. Script in the head section, is loaded before anyone uses it. 

<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function message()
{
alert("This alert box was called with the onload event")
}
</script>
</head>

<body onload="message()">

</body>
</html>


// External script  //

To run the same script on several pages, without writing the script on each and every page,write a script in an external file, and save it with a .js file extension.

Use the "src" attribute, from any of the pages to call this script

ex :

<script  src="sample.js">

</script>
