To insert a script in an HTML page, we use the <script> tag. Use the type attribute to define the scripting language

ex : <script type="text/javascript">
 

Then the <script> tag has to be closed

ex : </script>
 
Each code statement has to end with a semicolon if you want to put more than one statement on a single line.




//document.write // command for writing some output to a page.

  ex: document.write("Hello World!")



prog1
-------
<html>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("Hello World!")
</script>
</body>
</html>



Browsers that do not support scripts will display the script as page content. To prevent them from doing this, we may use the HTML comment tag:

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
    some statements
//-->
</script>
 

The two forward slashes at the end of comment line (//) are a JavaScript comment symbol. This prevents the JavaScript compiler from compiling the line.
