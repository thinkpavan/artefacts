Conditional Statements

if statement - use this statement if you want to execute a set of code when a condition is true 
if...else statement - use this statement if you want to select one of two sets of lines to execute 

	if( condition )
	{
		statements
	}
	else if ( condition )
	{
		statements
	}
	else
	{
		statements
	}


switch statement - use this statement if you want to select one of many sets of lines to execute 

	switch( <variable>)
	{
	  case constantvalue1:
		statements
		break;
		
	  case constantvalue1:
		statements
		break;
		
	  default :	
	    statements
	}


Looping
Very often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run a number of times. You can use looping statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following looping statements:

while - 
loops through a block of code while a condition is true 
   
    while( condition )
     {
	---
	---
	---

      }

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a condition is true 

     do
       {
	-----
	-----
	-----
       }while( condition );

for - run statements a specified number of times 

     for(  initialization ;  condition  ;  calculation )	
         {
	----------
	----------
	----------
        }
