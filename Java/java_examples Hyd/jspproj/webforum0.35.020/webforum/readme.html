<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><strong>JDK1.1 or better required. Servlet API
2.0.</strong></p>

<p>Beside the optional CSS file (for HTML client-side formatting)
and the provided locale file (English.properties,
Italian.properties or French.properties), the servlet requires
two configuration files that you may need to edit. The first file
set the global properties for the forum and the second one is a
user list. The user list file is specified in the global
properties file.</p>

<p>The servlet is called through the URL<br />
http://mydomaine/servlet/com.ondelette.servlet.webforum.WebForumServlet?_FORUMFILE_=myconfigfile<br />
</p>

<h3>In short... (you might want to check the sample configuration
files first)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Copy the *.class files in the "servlets" directory designated
by your server, this is usually a directory called servlet. Under
Tomcat, this will typically be a "classes" directory under your
WEB-INF directory which is itself under ROOT (often).</li>

<li>Copy a property file like "forumsample.properties" anywhere
on your system (but make sure that the JVM can read the file).
Let's assume you called this file "myconfigfile". Make sure that
the "MessageArchiveDirectory" directory is both readable and
writeable for the JVM. 

<p>Be careful about this choice because here's how you call your
servlet after that
http://mydomain/servlet/com.ondelette.servlet.webforum.WebForumServlet?_FORUMFILE_=path/to/propertiesfile.
You can use relative paths, as I do, but then your servlet engine
must always be started from the same directory ("user.dir").
Check with your sysadmin: Tomcat doesn't check these things in
any reasonable way.</p>
</li>

<li>Copy the locale properties file (English.properties,
French.properties...) in the location specified by
myconfigfile.</li>

<li>Copy a user list file in the location specified by
myconfigfile. The file can be empty. Make sure the file is
writable for the servlet.</li>

<li>You might need to copy a CSS file at the URL specified by
myconfigfile.</li>

<li>Launch the servlet with<br />
http://mydomain/servlet/com.ondelette.servlet.webforum.WebForumServlet?_FORUMFILE_=myconfigfile<br />
 where myconfigfile is the path to your configuration file (it
can be a relative path with respect to your JVM current directory
or an absolute path). Please note that some web servlet might
have a different alias for servlets (so it can be
http://mydomain/myservlets/... for example). <b>WARNING:</b>
again use relative paths carefully, the servlet expects the
current directory of the JVM to remain constant whenever the
server is restarted, if you restart the server from a different
directory using a weak script, you might change the current
directory of the JVM and then the JVM won't be able to find its
files.</li>

</ul>

<p>sample configuration file ("myconfigfile")&nbsp;:</p>

<pre>
MessageArchiveDirectory=SampleForumDirectory
ForumLocaleFile=English.properties
UserListFile=forumSampleUserList.properties
SaveDelay=60
ForumTitle=A title (may contain HTML)
ForumSubTitle=A subtitle (may contain HTML)
ForumFooter=place some HTML here for your footer
AuthorizationLevel=0
CSSURL=http://mydomain/sample/sample.css
WelcomeURL=http://mydomain/sample/forumsample.html
/*
* the following are optional properties
*/
FailedLoginURL=http://mydomain/sample/youfailedtologin.html
PrefixURL=http://mydomain/sample/somepieceofhtmltoputbefore.html
SuffixURL=http://mydomain/sample/somepieceofhtmltoputafter.html
</pre>

<p>Note&nbsp;: It isn't required to create the
MessageArchiveDirectory, the servlet will do it if needed, but
make sure the directory is writeable for the JVM.</p>

<p>The parameter "AutorizationLevel" allows you to limit access
to the forum to only these users with the proper autorization
level</p>

<p><strong>Definition of the autorization levels</strong></p>

<pre>
NORMAL = 0;
IDENTIFIEDGUEST = 2;
MEMBER = 32;
EXECUTIVEMEMBER = 64;   // can erase messages on the forum
VIPMEMBER = 128; // can erase messages on the forum, reset the forum, add and remove users to the user list
ADMIN = 256; // same as VIPMEMBER except that the user cannot be erased or create (must be added manually to the user list file)
</pre>

<p>We can add a line such as "PostPrivilege=x" where x is an
autorization number. This makes sure that the posting form is
only visible to users having at least the specified autorization
level. Posting is still possible for other users if they somebody
provide a proper posting form (possibly as an HTML page).</p>

<hr />
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it dangerous to have the servlet read arbitrary files
on my server (e.g. /etc/passwd) 

<p>The servlet will read the file only (never write to it) and
will check that it is a proper configuration file without ever
disclosing its content if it isn't a proper configuration
file.</p>
</li>

<li>I want to quickly check my installation? 

<p>Type
"http://mydomain/servlet/com.ondelette.servlet.webforum.WebForumServlet"
once the .class files are in place. You don't need to configure a
forum to check the installation.</p>
</li>

<li>I loose the messages on my forum after a few minutes. 

<p>Check that the MessageArchiveDirectory is writeable for the
servlet. Sometimes people use relative paths which makes things
complicated, if you need debugging help, consider using the
ServletWriteTest servlet that's part of this distribution.</p>
</li>

<li>My company wants to use this forum for a commercial web
site... can I use WebForum? What will it cost us? 

<p>Yes you can and it will be entirely free. Only if
you redistribute the software to clients do you have
the obligation of handing out your source code to your
client as part of this license. If you only use the
code for internal use, then the GPL doesn't say you must
release your changes. It would be nice, though, to 
contribute back some changes to the main tree.</p>
</li>

<li>I know it is free, but can I get commercial support in case
something goes wrong? 

<p>Yes you can, the servlet has been in used for years and
several people could help you.</p>
</li>

<li>Does it work under Unix (including Linux), under Windows? 

<p>Yes and yes. It should work everywhere servlet support is
available.</p>
</li>

<li>What is the servlet I should call and what parameter do I
need? 

<p>The main servlet is
com.ondelette.servlet.webforum.WebForumServlet. There are other
servlets, but this is the first one you'll want to check and use.
You need at least one parameter pointing to the file path of you
configuration file (a properties file, see above for
documentation) and that's the _FORUMFILE_ parameter.</p>
</li>

<li>Why isn't WebForum distributed with a War file for automatic
installation on servlet 2.2 compliant systems? 

<p>Currently, some systems only offer servlet 2.0 support
(specifically JServ under Apache). Future versions of WebForum
will have to support servlet 2.2 features. Creating a WAR file is
trivial, but I (Daniel Lemire) doesn't use them very much so I
didn't bother to create a script to package WebForum as a WAR
file, if you want to contribute such a script, it is more than
welcome!</p>
</li>

<li>Why only use JDK1.1 and servlet API 2.0. Isn't that obselete?


<p>Probably a bit obselete, but the design of WebForum is to keep
it low level. WebForum aims to be fast, feature complete, but not
bloated and with minimal requirements.</p>
</li>

<li>Ater Reading the main help file, I can figure out how this
system works at all. The Sample file contains french which I
can't understand! 

<p>Here's a recent sample file called
forumsample.properties:</p>

<pre>
/*

* webforum

*/
/*

<p>None of them contain any French. Only earlier versions
contained French documentation, everything has been converted to
English. Of course, this excludes sample HTML files that are not
part of the documentation such as forumsample.html since the text
there is irrelevant. It could be in any language and it wouldn't
matter. You are not supposed to use the HTML text, this only an
example of how you can call the servlet from HTML, but this only
applies to my current server and you really need to check the
documentation of your current servlet engine for this.</p>
</li>

<li>I have no clue how the servlet directory should be
structured. 

<p>Please check your servlet engine documentation on how to setup
servlets using packages. It should be as straight-forward as
copying the files and the directory provided with the
releases.</p>
</li>

<li>Am I supposed to copy the com directory (with sub-dirs
included) into the servlet dir? 

<p>Typically, yes.</p>
</li>

<li>How is the User list supposed to be structured? 

<p>It is actually generated by the servlet but you can add users
using the following syntax... simply add the following
text...&lt;USER&gt;&lt;LOGIN&gt;me&gt;/LOGIN&gt;&lt;PASSWORD&gt;mypass&lt;/PASSWORD&gt;&lt;EMAIL&gt;toto@wanadoo.fr&lt;/EMAIL&gt;&lt;LEVEL&gt;2&lt;/LEVEL&gt;&lt;/USER&gt;</p>
</li>

<li>My server crashed badly and my user list file was corrupted,
I'm no longer able to login as an administrator, how do I fix
this? 

<p>First reset the servlet, you can do this current by calling
the servlet with the parameter _RESET_ as such
http://www.ondelette.com/servlet/com.ondelette.servlet.webforum.WebForumServlet?_RESET_.
This will force the servlet to flush everything to disk and
reload the configuration. Now, once you have done this, manually
edit your user list file. Repeat the _RESET_ query
immediately.</p>

<p>Why two RESET? Because when the servlet exists, it saves its
configuration if a change happened, thus, it might be useless to
edit the user list file immediately.</p>

<p>If it fails (for example, if someonem, a pirate, is adding new
users every 1/10 of a second), shut down your servlet container,
edit the user list file and restart it.</p>
</li>

<li>The servlet works, but when it tries to display some
messages, it fails, throwing some kind of exception. How do I fix
this. 

<p>That should never happen, but if it does, try to edit the
index.txt file that goes with your posting board. You should find
it in the message archive directory. Check every number in the
file except the first, it should have a corresponding file with the same name
(files are named by numbers), if the file is not present, delete
the number in the index.txt file. Then, restart the servlet
(calling the _RESET_ query, see above). As above, you might have
to call _RESET_ twice.</p>
</li>

<li>I've lost messages on my posting board, what gives? 

<p>WebForum tries very hard to be safe, but if you server crash
hard, there is little chance to flush the messages to disk in
time.</p>
</li>

<li>It fails telling it can't find a config file! 

<p>It should give you the path it expects, try to check if the
file is there. Check it is readable (permissions).</p>
</li>

<li>My username/password uses UTF-8, yet it doesn't work! 

<p>User information is stored using ISO-8859-1.</p>
</li>

<li>Does the servlet support UTF-8 as part of its i18n support? 

<p>Yes, but if you don't use the latin encoding scheme, you need
to specify it in your locale configuration file. Use the
charset.encoding property. Messages should be saved/loaded in the
specified encoding. Be careful though not to change the encoding
scheme after some messages have be written as the servlet will
just load them up using the new encoding scheme without
conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>Does webforum has some kind of template mechanism so I can taylor the
look and feel? 

<p>Yes, for one thing, you can use the CSS file for
the basic look and feel. Then, you can use the SuffixURL
and PrefixURL property to load up some HTML before and
after the forum itself. This is far simplier than having
to use and learn another query language. If the URL points to
a text file, the entire text file is simply appended, but HTML
is processed so that only the body is included.
