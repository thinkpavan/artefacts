This readme file briefly explains what is here.


1. Teaching Outline
===================
The teaching outline for this course is in outline.doc

2. Slides
=========
This directory contains the PowerPoint slides used in this
course. 

The filenames of the slides end with a number (e.g.
prelim0, intro1), which indicate the order in which they are 
presented in class. 

Copies of the slides are handed out in class, so SAVE TREES 
by not printing them out again. If you do, then print 6 slides 
to a page.

3. Coding
=========
Most of the code examples used in the slides.

4. Examples
===========
Other code examples, from Java textbooks.


If you have any questions, please get in touch with me.
