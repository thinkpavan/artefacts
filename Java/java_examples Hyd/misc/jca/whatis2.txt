JCA is composed of three primary elements: 

A)System contracts 

System contracts define the connection between the application server and the EIS.

Three types of system contracts are defined: 
The connection management 
The transaction management
The security 	
( This will be implemented as part of resource adapter).

B)Client API
	The API can be specific to the resource adapter or it can be the standard Common Client
 Interface (CCI) as defined by JCA
 

C)Resource adapter module

The resource adapter module contains all of the elements necessary to provide
EIS connectivity to applications.

Specifically, the resource adapter module includes the following components:

1)The Java classes and interfaces that implement the resource adapter 
2)Any utility Java classes required by the resource adapter 
3)Any EIS-specific platform-dependent native libraries 
4)The deployment descriptor 


RA's has to be packed in RAR files ( same as jar ).



Some of the JCA RA's available from different vendors.
