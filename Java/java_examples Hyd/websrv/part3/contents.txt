web service implemented as a simple java class.

We need to follow the following rules while implementing webservice as
a plain java class.

1) must provide a no argument constructor.

2) must not start any thread from our code.

3) define all the methods that need to be exposed as web service operations as public.


Web services can be synchronous ( request-response) or
Asynchronous (one-way). This can be specified in invocation-style 
attribute of <operation> element in web-service.xml.
