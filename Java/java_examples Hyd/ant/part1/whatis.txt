Ant is like make which is used to automate the task of
building the applications.

Ant, similar to make can be used to do any task other
than building application.

In makefiles we use commands to carry out tasks.

In ant we use Ant Taska which are nothing but java
classes to carry out a taks.

Note: we can also run commands using exec task.

make uses make files. ant uses xml build files.

In ant's build file we can define the targets. A taget defines how
to carry out things like compiling, removing, creating directory etc.


A target may depend on other targets also.

For example : when we want to compile a set of java classes we may manually do

1) remove all the class files which are already created.

2) create a fresh directory for storing new class files.

3) create java class file using javac.

4) pack them all in a jar file.
