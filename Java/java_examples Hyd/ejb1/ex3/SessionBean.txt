the business methods of a session bean. This interface extends from
EnterpriseBean which is an empty interface (acts as a marker).

Following are the methods in this interface.

1) ejbActivate -- this method will be  called by the container when it
 activates a bean from pasive state.

2) ejbPassivate -- this method will be called by container when the container    passivates the bean. resource has to be realeased when this is called and
   they can be acquired again in activate method.

3) ejbRemove() -- called when the EJBObject is removed from the container.
   This will be called in one of the below casses.

   a) when client calls remove method on remote reference.
  
   b) when the time out value of bean expires.

4) setSessionContext -- called by the container to set the session context 
   of the bean. SessionContext object provides a way for the bean to interact 
   with the container. This method will be called when the instance is 
   created.
