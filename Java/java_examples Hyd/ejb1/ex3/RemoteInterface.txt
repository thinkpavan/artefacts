Remote Interface
================

Remote Interface declares all the business methods that are implemented by
EJB. We need to follow the following rules to create this interface.

1) Remote interface must extend from EJBObject.

2) Since all the business methods are invoked from the remote clients, we
   should decalre that the methods throws RemoteException apart from 
   Application specific exceptions.

	Note: we are not going to provide a class that implements the
above interface. This interface will be implemented by the EJB container.
we need to provide a seperate class implementing only the business methods.
