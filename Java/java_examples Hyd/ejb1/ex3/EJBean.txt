EJB should implement the business defined in RemoteInterface and this
class should impement SessionBean interface. (EntiyBean interface in case
of entity beans).

Following rules has to be followed in creating EJB

1) implement all methods declared in Entity/SessionBean interface. This
   is required and the complier also enfoces this since we have to
   declare that this class implements Session/EntityBean.

2)    public void ejbCreate() method has to be created. This method
   will be called by the container when the ejb is created. This method
   should return void. (Note: Create method in home interface returns
   remote interface). If we have multiple create methods defined in home
   interface for each create we should have a corresponding ejbCreate
   method.

3)  public void ejbRemove() method has to be implemented which will be called    when ejb is removed by the container.

   (Note: complier doesn't enfore the implementation of the above two 
   methods)

4) Business methods that were defined in remote interface.

  for example if a method

	public void BusMethod1() throws remoteException in defined in Remote
        interface. Then we need to provide the following method in EJB.
     
        public void BusMethod1() here we need not declare that the method
        throws RemoteException as the method on this are called from 
        EJBObject which is created by the container.

   (Note: complier doesn't enfore the implementation of the above two 
   methods)
