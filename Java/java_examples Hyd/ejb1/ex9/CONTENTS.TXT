In this example we will see how to call a business method on one bean from 
other bean. We will also show some more transaction attributes in this
example. Here we will use two ejb's 
1) BeanClient which invokes method on other bean

2) we will use the BeanServer as another bean

with this example we will highlight the issue of
re-entrance.

This example also shows how to pack more than one ejb
in a jar


we can try out different combinations like tx_mandatory
and tx_new_required on Serverbean
