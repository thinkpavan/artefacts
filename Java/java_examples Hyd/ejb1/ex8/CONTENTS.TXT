This example is same as that of part7, but we configured this bean as
stateless session bean. ( in earlier versions we configured as statefull
session , that is why we have given it's name as SFTransaction.)


When you use ejbc with this example supplied with weblogic 5.1
the compiler gives error message saying that we shouldn't implement Sessionsync
interface with stateless session bean.
