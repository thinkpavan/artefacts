Shows how to write a message driven bean.


-----------------
1) A message mean doesn't have a home,localhome, remote, local interfaces.

2) Message driven bean have a single method onMessage(). This
   method will be called when the message is placed in queue.

Mesage beans are stateless. they cannot give a return value, but they
can post a message back on the queue.

---------------------------------------
message driven bean has to implement

javax.jms.MessageListener's onMessage method.

and

javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean's ejbRemove and setMessageDrivenContext
methods.
