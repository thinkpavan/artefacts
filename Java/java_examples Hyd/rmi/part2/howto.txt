We can start the server,rmiregistry and client on the same machine.

But in a typical RMI system the server and client may be running on two
different machines.

To configure the system properly:

For the server, the following classes must be available.

Remote interface definitions 
service implementations 
Skeletons for the implementation classes for jdk1.1 
Stubs for the implementation classes 
All other classes used by the server.

For the client, the following classes must be available.

Remote interface definitions 
Stubs for the remote service implementation classes 
Server classes for objects used by the client 
All other client classes
