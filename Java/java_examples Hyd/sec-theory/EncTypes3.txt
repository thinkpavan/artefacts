Two types of Encryption

symmetric cipher : uses single secrete key to encrypt/decrypt.

   These algorithms are faster.

Currently data encryption standard (DES) is being used and in future it
will be replaced by advanced encryption standard (AES)

Asymmetric ciphers : uses two keys known as private (which is kept as secret
and public key which is known to any one).

encryption can be done using private/public key.

If encrytion is done by public key then decryption can be done by private key only.

If encrytion is done by private key then decryption can be done by public key only.
