We are using the tools that are available with jdk to do this. There are some many tools using which u can do this.

1) create public / private key pair.

  use keytool -genkey -alias newkey 
command which will generate a pair for u and store it in a key store.

2) generate certficate signing request 

  Use keytool -certreq -alias newky.

This generates an output which can be sent to CA's like verisign.
(verisign charges for signing the certificate).

3) After receiving the certificate u can import the certificate into
U'r key store.

use keytool -import -alias impkey -file newkey.cer

4) when ever u want to send a signed document u can send the certificate
to the reciever so that the receiver can find that the public key belongs to u only.


keytool -export -alias newkey -file newkey.cer.


5) To verify what is there in the certificate u can use

keytool -printcert -file newkey.cer.

(note: when u create a key pair using key tool it genetrates a certificate signed by u'r key only)

6) If u want o see what is there is key store u can use

keytool -list command

NOTE: Keystore is a place where u keep your's and other's keys and certificates.
