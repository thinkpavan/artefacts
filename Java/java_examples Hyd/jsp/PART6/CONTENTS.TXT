db.jsp  -- shows how to connect to the database and fetch from the database.
In this we will show how to connect and fetch data by writing code in jsp
directly . (U can also use a bean which has the whole logic of connection to 
database a perform the operations against the database). we will discuss
the strategies to be used when connecting to database and performing action 
against the database in class. Before running this example make sure that 
the driver is placed in the class path of u'r servlet engine.

With all the examples we have seen we can build any kind of web application.
U only need to put all the concepts together to make a great web application.



Thanks
