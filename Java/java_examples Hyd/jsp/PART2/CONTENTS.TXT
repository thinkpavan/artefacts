Directives -- list of directives described in jsp specifications

Implicit vairables -- List of variables available for accesssing from the 
page

1) buffer.jsp   -- we set the buffer size to a small value
to observe autoflush directive

2) buffer1.jsp  -- shows how autoflush=true sends the content
when buffer is full.

we tested these two on weblogic4.5.1 and servletexec2.x. 
and we got the expected result but in case of buffer.jsp
these emgines should have returned an error code instead of
doing nothing. We hope that these product vendors will
make the modifications for this.

3) run nobuffer.jsp also and check the result.

===========================================================================


4) testerror.jsp  shows how to use error pages to capture exceptions.
Place errpage.jsp file also in the same directory as that of testerror.jsp.

5) method.jsp  -- shows how to create methods in jsp page.

( we found a bug in weblogic 4.5.1 implementation of jsp while running 
method.jsp method, This runs fine on servletexec).
