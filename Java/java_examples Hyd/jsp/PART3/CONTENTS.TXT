usebean.jsp -- shows how to use bean from a jsp. This is the preferred
	       mechanism to seperate content from business logic ( we at
	       inetsolv love and use webmacro instead jsp solution for our
               internal development as this framework is better in seperating
	        content from code).

change the scope to page,application and check the output generated by jsp
engine. (run usebean1 and usebean2)


processform.jsp -- shows how to process form elements

simpleform.jsp -- this shows how to generate the form and process it from 
same jsp.
