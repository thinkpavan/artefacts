1) Plainhtml -- check readme.txt for description on this
examples.

2) Pagedir.jsp -- this example shows how to use page 
directives , also shows about how to use expressions in the
jsp file.

In pagedir1.jsp example we have set language to unknown.
and ran this on weblogic and servletexec. We expected them to give an error message but both of them didn't gave any error 
message after some time the browser disconnected from the server reporting that the page couldn't be fetched. ( note:
server vendors should have implemneted logic throwing exception that the language is not supported).

3) include.jsp -- shows how to include copyright notices etc.

(note: try to save the same file as .jsp and include it and check).

4) scriptlet.jsp  -- shows how to use scriptlets in jsp.

5) scriptlet1.jsp -- same as above but slightly different impl.

6) scriptlet2.jsp -- same as above but slightly different impl.
