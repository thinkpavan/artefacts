1) Plainhtml.jsp  -- in this example we will write a simple html file but we will use the extension as jsp for the file.
This example is to demonstrate how the jsp will be executed by the jsp enabled products.

Running the example under servletexec

1) place the file under Documentroot of iis (i.e c:\inetpub\wwwroot).

2) in u'r browser type http://hostname/plainhtml.jsp.

Note: u will observe that the webserver takes lot of time to generate output for the first time . Try to close the browser and open it again and give the same url now u can get the 
output immediately.

Important Note: As our students know how to create a servlet and always like to know what happens at the "back" . we sugest
u to check for the file with the name _plainhtml_xjsp.java
under c:\inetpub\servlet_ISAPI\servlets\pagecompile. This is the servlet file that is generated by servletexec.

To run this example under weblogic.

1) copy the jsp file under c:\weblogic\myserver\public_html 
directory . (this directory is configured to be the doc_root
by default.

2) from u'r browser use http://hostname:7001/plainhtml.jsp
(by default weblogic is confgured to listen at 7001 port).


Before running this configure weblogic to serve jsp files. We
will explain this in class.

weblogic generate the class with a different name. (find the name
and location of the file on u'r own).

We strongly urge the students to make a habbit of learning about
how to place the jsp under different prodcuts. Here at our lab
U can use tomcat. (Pl. read tomcat document for this).

make a habbit of reading the documents that accompanies the product.


( we had a problem running the jsp for the first time on weblogic. Later
on we have used javac from sun jdk to compile the page and solve the
problem).
