Jsp supports a set of tags like bean tag etc. 
We can extend the tags that are supported by implementing a tag library.

Maintainance of jsp can be simplefied if we can avoid the use of jsp 
elements that embed scripting language code in the page.

To use custom tags the library has to be loaded. This can be done by
using taglib directive. 

tag library is packaged as a jar file MANIFEST.MF in the
directory META-INF. The jar file representing jsp tag library must
include taglib.tld ( tag library description ).

For implementing tag handlers we use the package
javax.servlet.jsp.tagext

Tag and BodyTag interfaces are part of the above packages
which we need to implement directly or we can extend TagSupport
and BodyTagSupport classes.

BodyTag is for handlers that needs to process the body content
of the jsp tag used in the page.

sample custom tags

Tag with body:

<namespace:tag>
  body
</namespace:tag>

Tag without body:

<namespace:tag>
  body
</namespace:tag>
