1) Compile GetAllSubPackages.java

2) Build a file containing a listing of package names, where each rootdir is a directory where package directories are rooted
example : java GetAllSubPackages pack.txt .

3) Then use @packages.txt for your source packages
example: javadoc -d doc @pack.txt

This step creates documentation in doc directory for packages listed in pack.txt
