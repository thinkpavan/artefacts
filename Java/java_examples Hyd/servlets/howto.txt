Steps to configure Tomcat.

Main configuration file for Tomcat is TOMCAT_DIR/conf/server.xml

According to javasoft standards we can create any no of web app's and run on a
single servlet container.

A web application is defined as a hierarchy of directories and files in a standard layout.
Such a hierarchy can be accessed without packing, or in a "packed" form known as a
Web ARchive, or WAR file. 

There are many ways of deploying our servlets on tomcat.

1) create web application directory according to standard format under 
TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory.

2) copy war file under TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory.

3) use tomcat admin tool to deploy a webapp.

4) Add a <Context> entry in the TOMCAT_HOME//conf/server.xml configuration file


Directory layout for web apps

Under the document root. we can place html , jsp and other files.

/WEB-INF/web.xml  is the configuration file of our application.

/WEB-INF/classes/ to place java classes required for our application.

/WEB-INF/lib/ to place jar files required for our application.


Tomcat specific.

TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib 

 ---------------JAR files placed here are visible both to web applications and internal Tomcat code.

TOMCAT_HOME/shared/lib

---------------JAR files placed here are visible to all web applications, but not to internal Tomcat code.
