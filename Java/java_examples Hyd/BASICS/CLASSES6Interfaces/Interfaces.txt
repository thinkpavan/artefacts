Interfaces

	An Interface is a collection of method definitions which provides template for
the creation of a new class.

1) An Interface decalres one or more abstract methods and it can have contants

2) All the methods should be abstract in interface

3) All methods in an interface are public

4) None of the methods in Interface can be Private, Protected, Static, Synchoronized, Native.

5) All methods in interface are abstract whether or not marked as abstract.

6) A class can implement (not extend) any no of interfaces

7) A reference to interface can be declared.

8) An object of type Interface cannot be created.

9) A reference to Interface can refer to the object of class which implements the interface.

10) An interface can implement another interface.

11) Interfaces forces the classes to implement all the methods in the classes that 
    implement the interface.

12) All fields in Interface are implicitly public, static and final.

13) A  class that implement an Interface and does not provide an implementation 
for some of the methods in Interface becomes Abstract Class.
