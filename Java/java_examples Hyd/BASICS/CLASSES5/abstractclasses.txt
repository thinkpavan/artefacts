Abstract class

1) An abstract class can contain any no of instance variables and methods.

2) An abstract class can contain a method with/without method body.

3) A method without method body is also known as abstract method.

4) An instance of abstact class cannot be created.

5) An abstract class can have 0 or any no of abstact method.

6) Java complier ensures that all the methods that are declared as abstracted are 
   implemented in the concrete subclass of the abstract class.

7) A refernce to abstract class type can be created and it can be used to refer to any class
   in the inheritance chain as a normal class.

8) An abstract methods ( methods without implementation) can be declared only in abstract
   classes.

Final class:

	A class can be declared final so that no one can create a sub class of the class.

9) Since a sub class cannot be created for final classes an abstract class cannot be declared
   as final class.
