Exception: An exception is an error condition that voilates the rule
of Java program. For example if we try to read a non existing file from
the disk, an I/O exception will be thrown.

1) Exception are thrown by methods to indicate the error condition.
   For example: A method which opens a file can throw an exception
                if it is not able to open the file for some reason
 		to indicate error.

2) Any method that calls another method should either handle the exception
   condition by using " Exception Handler code" or throw an exception
   to indicate the error.

3) There are two kinds of exceptions in Java Language 
	a) Checked Exception and
	b) Un Checked Exception.

4) All checked exceptions are checked by the compiler at compile time.

5) Java compiler will not check for unchecked exceptions. These exceptions
   are also called as run time exceptions ( These exceptions are detected
   at run time).

6) Runtime exceptions are considered as un recoverable and therefore
   we donot handle them.
