The XML Schema language is also referred to as XML Schema Definition (XSD).

Instead of using DTD we can use XSD to define what is valid in a XML doc.


XSD can be used to define
	elements that can appear in a document .
	attributes that can appear in a document. 
	which elements are child elements. 
	order of child elements. 
	number of child elements. 
	whether an element is empty or can include text. 
	data types for elements and attributes. 
	default and fixed values for elements and attributes. 

Why Schema's

	extensible to future additions.
	richer and more useful than DTDs.
	Written in XML.
	support data types.
	support namespaces.
