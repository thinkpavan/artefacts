Parser is a software we use to maipulate XML documents.

CDATA will not be parsed by parser where as PCDATA will be
parsed by parser.

The following are called a Entities.
Entities act as replcaement texts.

&lt; < less than 
&gt; > greater than 
&amp; & ampersand  
&apos; ' apostrophe 
&quot; " quotation mark 

<element>10000 &lt;  100000</element> 

If element is of type PCDATA then the parser gives you
10000 < 100000.

What is a namespace.

why we need name spaces.

<per:root xmlns:h="http://www.inet.com/myns/">
   <pre:subelem> some text here </pre:sub>
</pre:root> 

W3C namespace specification states that the namespace itself should

be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

The only purpose of URI  is to give the namespace a unique name.

Uniform Resource Identifiers
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters which identifies
an Internet Resource. The most common URI is the Uniform Resource Locator
(URL) which identifies an Internet domain address.
