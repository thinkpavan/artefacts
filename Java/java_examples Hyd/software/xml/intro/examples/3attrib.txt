XML Attributes



In HTML (and in XML) attributes provide additional information about elements:

<img src="computer.gif">
<a href="demo.asp"> 

Attributes often provide information that is not a part of the data. 

<file type="image/gif">computer.gif</file> 

Attribute values must always be enclosed in quotes, but either single or double quotes can be used.

Elements or Attributes

Data can be stored in child elements or in attributes.


<book rating="good">
  <title>Book Name</title>
</book> 
	or
<book>
  <rating>good</rating>
  <title>Book Name</title>
</book> 

in this example rating defined as element has an advantage. ???.


Problems:

attributes cannot contain multiple values.
attributes are not easily expandable.
attributes cannot describe structures.
attributes are more difficult to manipulate by program code .
attribute values are not easy to test against a DTD.


Most people follow the following guidline.

metadata (data about data) should be stored as attributes, and that data itself should be stored as elements.

example prodid etc.

A "Well Formed" XML document is a document that conforms to the XML syntax rules.

Not all well formed docs are valid.

How can we say whether a doc is valid or not.

We use DTD's ( Document type Definitions) to store the rules that talks about
which elements are valid and what they can contain in DTD.

Looking at the DTD we can say whether the docs are valid or not.
