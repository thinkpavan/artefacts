XML can be used to define our own set of tags which suits our
requirement.

XML is not a replcaement to HTML.

XML is mainly used as way to transfer data in a portable way between
application ( this is the main use of XML).

In most of the literature on XML you will find xml is used to describe the
data but is it really the fact ?


Some of the applications of XML are

CML -- chemical markup language that is used to describe molecular structure.
Mathml -- for representing mathematical formulae.
XHTML -- reformalation of html using xml.
CDF-- channel definition format.
Now most of the files that stores the configuration details are stored
using XML (ex. ejb deployment descriptors, web application configuration
from servlet 2.2 spec).
B2B -- XML is now being pushed mainly in this area . This enables two
entirely different products to exhange data using XML.
(most of the people in the market has misconception about xml related
to this).
