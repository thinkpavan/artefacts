In PO.xml example we have used a set of tags.

In xml we have a way of defining what tags are valid in a particular xml
doc and what are not valid. 

For example I cannot write <purchaseOrder> tag when creating a document
using mathml.

To define our own language ( set of tags) we need to define a 
DTD( document type definition).

Defining DTD is very simple if we know a bit about regular expression
we use with most of the unix commands like grep,egrep for seraching for
patterns in text.

DTD can be internal to the xml document or internal to an XML document.
