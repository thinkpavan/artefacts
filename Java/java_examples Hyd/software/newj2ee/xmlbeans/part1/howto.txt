1) use scomp command to generate java classes from the schema.

ex: scomp -d classes -src source schema.xsd

The above command creates java sources in source directory and classes will
be placed in classes directory.

2) Before writing the program check the sources generate to get the information on
   methods we can use.

3) develop the code to process xml document accoring to your application requirement.


use xbeans.jar and classes directory as part of your CLASSPATH.
