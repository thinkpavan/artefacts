shows how to create a simple session bean.


Follow the steps given below to create a stateless session bean

1)  create Home interface

2)  create Remote interface with all the business methods.

3) Implement the business methods and additional methods in EJB class.

4) place the classes generated from the above in appropriate directory.
   we placed them under WL_HOME\classes (this directory is listed in 
   class path).

5) use ejbdeployer tool to create a serialized file for deployment
 descriptor. ( this is simple way of creating DD).

6) run ejbc -d c:\weblogic\classes dd.ser. this command creates all the
   files that are required for deploying ejb. (dd.ser is the one that is
   created in step 5)

7)  create manifest file with following lines


Manifest-Version: 1.0

Name: part1/DD.ser
Enterprise-Bean: True

8) create ejb-jar file using the following command

   jar cvfm HWorld.jar manifest part1.

9) Place the jar file in c:\weblogic\myserver

10) make modification to weblogic.properties file by
adding the following lines.

weblogic.ejb.deploy=C:/weblogic/myserver/HWorld.jar. (This line will
be already there in the file we just need to add info related to HWorld.jar)

11) stop weblogic server and start it again.

12) run the client to test the application.

Note: procedure for creating ejb-jar is much more simplified with weblogic 
5.1 , read readme5.1.txt to package EJB.

Problem:

  Create u'r own session bean with four different methods following
the above procedure and deploy the bean and test it using two clients.

Note: As it is very difficult to create the first bean we suggest 
u to copy all the files in this directory to u'r working directory and
change the class names by substuting myFirstBean for HWorld and then
add three more simple methods.
