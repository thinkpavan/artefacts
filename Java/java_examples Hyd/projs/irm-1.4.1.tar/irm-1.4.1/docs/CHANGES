IRM 1.4.0 CHANGES

- PHP 4.1 is required
- Made sure all of the newly implemented classes worked correctly.
- Scrapped some unfeasible or too-long-to-implement features
- Fixed as many bugs as possible.

IRM 1.3.4 CHANGES
- Added "Full Name" to the user information.
- Added FastTrack tracking -- allows all tracking information to be entered
	in one page.  In addition, it allows templates to be set up to automatically
	fill in some of the FastTrack fields.
- Modified the way Followups are displayed when "Show Followups" is selected in
	the computer-info screen.
- Redesigned the Tracking and Followup systems (no noticable difference should
	be visible to the end user).
- Changed the "tracking-followups" page (The page you see when you click "More
	Info" on the right side of a work request) so that it is more clear, and
	only requires a single "Update" button be pushed for multiple changes.
- Changed the way that priorities are displayed, it now displays priorities by
	name
- Changed the tracking display so that the Full Name is displayed in the
	"Assigned" and "Author" fields if possible.  Also set it up so that the 
	Full Names are hypertext links to the user-info.php script.
- Modified the user-info.php script to display all work requests currently 
	assigned to the specified user.
- Changed the tracking display so that the date is displayed in a new,
	more user friendly format.
- Changed the user add script such that the new user's Type is a dropdown
	box instead of a textbox.
- Modified the way email is sent when tracking is updated.
- Modified the way tracking is displayed so that groups are not set up as
	hypertext links, only computers.
- Still no update for the 1.3.1 users who have software information -- my 
	apologies.  We will try and get it in for 1.3.5.
	

IRM 1.3.3 CHANGES
- Added Knowledgebase and FAQ sections to IRM (the FAQ is a subset of the
	Knowledgebase).
- Fixed a bug in the computers-info display that caused a "No tracking Found"
	message to display whenever a computer was not part of a group, even
	if the computer had large amounts of tracking against it.
- Started to move all HTML code to capital letters.  Makes the HTML source
	much easier to read.
- NOTE: Please do not upgrade from 1.3.1 if the if the information you have 
	stored in your software setup is important to you.
	

IRM 1.3.2 CHANGES
- Many more typo/bug fixes.  
- Added a "Technician" user type.  The technician can do everything
	that an admin could do in the past with the exception of user 
	management.  Admins can do everything that a tech can do, but they
	can also do user management.
- Modified the "Setup Users" stuff.  The page was entirely to painful to
	use with a large number of users.
- Most of config.inc.php has been moved into the database, and can be 
	modified from the "System Configuration" selection on the "setup" web 
	page.  Note: The system configuration can not be modified by the 
	new "Technician" user type, only by an admin.
- Started the process of modifying the mailing system.  All user updates
	(new followups, etc.) should come from the tech making the update,
	not some randome "irm" or "anonymous" user.  Also worked to clean
	up the text in the email sent out so that it is more clear to
	customers what the email is about.
- Modified the "header" function so that only areas that a user is allowed
	to view are displayed.
- Removed all "short" php tags. This causes no noticable difference to 
	the user.
- Major changes to software management/licensing set up.  IF YOU DEPEND ON
	THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN YOUR SOFTWARE SETUP, DO NO UPGRADE TO 1.3.2.

IRM 1.3.1 CHANGES
- Lots of bug fixes.  All known typos/bugs should be fixed with the 
	exception of the db abstraction stuff.  The db abstraction class used
	in 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 won't exist in 1.3.2 because it doesn't work well
	on install.
- Modified the status options, options are now as follows:
	* Active - Status that should be assigned by a tech when he/she is working
		on the specified tracking.
	* Assigned - Status that is automatically set when a tracking item is 
		assigned to a technician.
	* Complete - Status that should be selected when a tracking item has
		been completed successfully.
	* New - Default status when new tracking is added.
	* Old - Status that should be selected when a tracking item has not
		been completed successfully, but no further action will be taken to
		complete the tracking successfully.
	* Wait - This status should be set when a tech is waiting on something
		outside of his/her own control to complete the tracking.


IRM 1.3.0 CHANGES
- Moved all .php3 files to .php extensions
- Moved the include files into a subdirectory named "include"
- Created a $USERPREFIX variable -- fixes problems that we have seen
	on login failures where people were seeing "page not found" errors.
- Set up a new abstracted database using class.DBI from
	http://evil.inetarena.com/php
- Rewrote the setup/install procedure due to changes forced by the db 
	abstraction.

IRM 1.0.2 CHANGES
- Software sorting now makes sense

- Deleteing templates deletes associated software
- Adding port now no longer gives error

IRM 1.0.1 CHANGES
- Fixed connectdb() error in tracking-assign.
- Fixed group memebership table in computers-info

IRM 1.0 CHANGES
- New DB Abstraction class which makes everything sort of compatible
	Currently MySQL is supported, but you only need to change
	a few function calls to get it working with PostgreSQL, etc.
- New networking port system.  Allows you to interconnect computers and
	network devices.
- New IRM command center which includes the auditing feature of IRM
	and serves as a quick-look at what has been happening when you
	login.
- Cleaned up the look and feel of IRM in a few places.
- Fixed a bug which prevented tracking from appearing in some cases.

	shows group membership in computers-info.php3

	completely if the user was upgrading from an old install.

	to happen before I'm proud of the code, but it appears to be functional.
- Added (then found out it was already there but not documented) and therefore 
	only modified the ability to configure whether the name search was 
	available from the helper.php3 screen.
