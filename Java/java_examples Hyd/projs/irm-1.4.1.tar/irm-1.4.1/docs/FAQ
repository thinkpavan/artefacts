IRM FAQ
-------

When things just don't go as they should.

1.  When I log in, IRM gives me 'Undefined function mysql_connect in...'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple problem, simple solution.  When you compiled PHP (you did compile
it from sources, right?), you omitted the --with-mysql flag.  Simply run
./configure again, and make sure you use --with-mysql and
--enable-track-vars.

2. setup.php doesn't really seem to do anything?
------------------------------------------------

IRM at this point requires register_globals to be enabled. This is a PHP setting
which can supposedly be enabled in php.ini (doesn't always work as advertised) or
in a .htaccess file. IRM includes two .htaccess files in both the root and users/
directory, but Apache by default ignores .htaccess files. You will need to make
sure Apache is reading them by setting this option in httpd.conf:

<Directory "/path/to/irm">
    AllowOverride Options FileInfo Limit
</Directory>


3. When I log in, I get 'failed to open ../irm.inc ...'
-------------------------------------------------------

You didn't follow the instructions.  You have to edit
irm.inc and set the 'root path' variable after the copyright
information
