# Welcome to the IRM Configuration File.
# Configuration options follow this syntax:
# 	$variable = "<value>";
# It is important that you put he double-quotes around the value.
# If you should need to insert a double-quote as the value its self,
#  escape it out by using a backslash (\").  For example:
#	$variable = "The dog said, \"I like beans.\"  Then he ate some.";
# Comments are marked with a hash, #, character as the first symbol.  
#
# Enjoy!
