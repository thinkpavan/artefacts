AuthenticationTypeHelp=This determines how a user is authenticated to the help desk.

You must disable anonymous logins in IIS on the help desk directory and enable basic and/or NTLM authentication.</li> <li>Database: This method will store the username and password of the users in the help desk database.  Users will be allowed to create accounts from the main page.</li> <li>External: This will allow you to authenticate the user by some other means and pass the username to the help desk.  You can pass the username to the help desk by three different methods.  You can set the session variable "lhd_ext_uid" to the user name (i.e. Session("lhd_ext_uid") = username) and then point the user to logon.asp.  You can send the username via a form posted to logon.asp with the field "lhd_ext_uid" set to the username. Finally, you can send the username to logon.asp via a query string (i.e. /logon.asp?lhd_ext_uid=username).</li>
