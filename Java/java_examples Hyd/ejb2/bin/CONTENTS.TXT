This examples shows how to use ejb from a servlet


In this demonstartion we have just tried to execute a 
method on ejb object and used the output to generate  
html content. In building complex business web sites
we can use ejb's to provide business logic and 
presentation logic can be written in servlets.

1) copy the servlet class to c:\weblogic\myserver\servlet_classes
2) configure the servlet making entry in weblogic.properties
3) Execute the servlet.


We can execute method on any type of EJB from a servlet or applet( beware
of security issues in applets).
