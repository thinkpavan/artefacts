to connect to Oracle or any other sql server,msaccess
you need a driver to connect
you can create a driver object
through control panel--odbc32---add new driver choose the
driver associated with backend Oracle Driver for Oracle,MicrosoftOracle Driver
Microsoft MSAccessDriver
enter dsn(data source name)--any name
enter server name--tit
and use this object while connecting to a driver

we have 4 types of driver
type1
  is created by sun microsystems using c libraries.it is JdbcOdbcDriver.
  it creates a bridge between java and odbc(odbc32) call Jdbcodbc bridger
  and odbc is connected to any rdbms.(oracle,msaccess)
  it is  a dynamic link library(JdbcOdbc.dll)--jdk1.3\jre\bin
  jdbc:odbc:dsn,"use","passwd
  //loading driver in buffer
  Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");
  //making a connection
  Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:dsn","user","passwd);

type2
oracle native driver--thinclient(8i),thick client(7.3)
     java.sql.DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());
     Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@100.100.100.1:1521:tit","scott","tiger")
 search for  classes111.zip and put bin and lib in classpath and then use it
type3
-----
   this is a driver used over the internet in client server technology
type4
-----
    driver over internet but for 3 tier architechtures(RMI,EJB)
    weblogicdriver
