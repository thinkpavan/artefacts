	Types of iterators and their description
	
	
	
input		used to read from a container. An input iterator can
			be move only in the forword direction( ie begining 
			of the container to the end of the container) one 
			element at a time. Input iterator uses a one pass 
			algorithm. Ie the same iterator cannot be used to 
			pass throuh the same sequence twise


output		used to write an element to a container. An output 
			iterator can move onlu in the forword direction
			one element at a time. Output iterator supports one
			 pass algorithm.
							
							
forword		Combines the capabilities of input and output
			iterator and retain their position in the container
	
	
bidirectional	Combines the capabilities of a forword iterator with 
				the ability  to move in the backword direction 
				Forword iterator supports multipass algorithms
							
	
	
random access	Combies the capability of a bidirectional iterator 
				with the ability to directly access any element of 
				container (ie. to jump forword or backwords by an 
				arbitraty location)
