  Class : It is a user defined datatype. An entity
  is defined as class. A class contains group of
  variables and methods that operate on these
  variables.

 Object : A variable of class is called as Object,
 because it has predefined methods of accessing.

 Data Encapsulation :  The procedure of enclosing
 data and methods that operate on these data items
 is called Data Encapsulation.

     The variables declared inside a class are
 called as data members of the class.

    The functions defined inside the class are
 called member functions of the class.

    syntax :

      class  <class name>
	{
	   <mode of accessibility> :
	     data members
	     member functions

	   <mode of accessibility> :
	     data members
	     member functions

	};


    // public //
	  If a member is public, it can be accessed
    by any function. In C++, members of a struct or
    union are public by default.

    // private // 
	If a member is private, it can only be
    accessed by member functions and friends of the
    class in which it is declared. Members of a
    class are private by default. 

    // protected // 
	If a member is protected, its access is the
    same as for private. In addition, the member can
    be used by member functions and friends of classes
    derived from the declared class, but only in
    objects of the derived type.
