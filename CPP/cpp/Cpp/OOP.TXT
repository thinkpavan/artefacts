// Features of proceure Oriented Programming (POP)  //

*  Emphasis is on doing things. i.e., Algorithm development is given importance.

*  Most of the data is placed global which is accessible by all the functions in the program.

*  Large programs are divided into small blocks called functions.

*  It employs Top - Down approach.


// Features of Object Oriented Programming  (OOP) //

*  Data is the critical element in the program

*   Almost all the data is hidden i.e., only methods which operate on the data are made available to the user.

*  Large programs are divided into objects.

*  Code reusability is possible without any modification

*  Template functions and template classes can be created

*  It employs Bottom Up approach.
