 Static data members : A static member of a class
  is allocated memory even before instantiation of
  the class. All the objects of the class share
  the same variable i.e., only one variable is
  made available for all the objects of the class.
  A static member of the class can be accessed 
  with class name and scope resolution(::) operator.

Static Member Functions : These functions can be 
invoked with the class name. The functions are used 
to handle static data of the class.
