   Inline Functions : The functions mentioned almost
   in a line are called Inline Functions.
      Inline functions are best reserved for
   small, frequently used functions.

	Loops, switch , and declaration of static
   variables is not valid in inline functions.
	The member functions defined inside the
   class are by default inline functions.
	The keyword inline is a request to
   consider the the function as inline, and the
   request may not be considered if the code is
   lengthy or by using loops,etc.
