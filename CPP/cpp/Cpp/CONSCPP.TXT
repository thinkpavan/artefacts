 Constructors
============

      It is a member function of the class with same
 name as the class. It is invoked implicitly whenever
 an instance(i.e., Object) of the class is created.
Constructors  doesnot have any return datatype

      The features which an object of the class should
 possess when it is instantiated are mentioned in the
 constructor. It is used for initializing the object.

  Types of Constructors
  ======================
  1 . Default Constructor.
  2 . Parameterised Constructer.
  3 . Copy Constructor.


  1 . Default Constructor :

      A default constructor is created automatically
  if the class definition is not containing any
  constructor.

  2 . Parameterised  Constructor : A construtor with 
input parameters is called Parameterised 
constructor. A class may contain any no. of 
parameterised constructors (But no two constructors 
should be matching).

 3 . Copy Constructor :
	It is a constructor with one input parameter i.e., a reference variable to an object of the same class.
	This constructor is used to construct an 
object with the features of an existing object. A 
default copy constructor is created which contains 
the code as copy all the features of input object 
into the current object.

	syntax :

  	<classname>(<classname>&      <obj>)
                       {
		------
		-----

	         }






  Destructor
=========
          It is member function with the same name 
of the class preceded with a tilde(~) operator. It is 
invoked implicitly when an object is destroyed. The 
code to be executed when an object expires is 
furnished in the destructor.

          A destructor doesn't have any input arguements and doesn't have a return datatype.

               ex
	~Sample()
   	    {
	        ------
	        ------
	    }
