Operator Overloading
  ---------------------
	The method of defining a new implementation
  for existing operators is called  Operator Overloading.

    syntax  :

  RDT	operator  <operator>(Parameters,...)

	  {

	    ---
	    ----
            ---
	  }	

  Operators are overloaded for better readability
  of the programs.
