Singleton
</center></h1>

<h3>Intent</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of
access to it. [GoF, p127]
</li><li>Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on
first use".
</li></ul>


<h3>Problem</h3>

Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object.  Additionally,
lazy initialization and global access are necessary.


<h3>Discussion</h3>

Make the class of the single instance object responsible for creation,
initialization, access, and enforcement.  Declare the instance as a
private static data member.  Provide a public static member function
that encapsulates all initialization code, and provides access to the
instance.<p>

The client calls the accessor function (using the class name and scope
resolution operator) whenever a reference to the single instance is
required.</p><p>

Singleton should be considered only if all three of the following
criteria are satisfied:
</p><ul>
<li>Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
</li><li>Lazy initialization is desirable
</li><li>Global access is not otherwise provided for
</li></ul>

If ownership of the single instance, when and how initialization
occurs, and global access are not issues, Singleton is not sufficiently
interesting.<p>

The Singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an
application-specific number of instances.</p><p>

The "static member function accessor" approach will not support
subclassing of the Singleton class.  If subclassing is desired, refer
to the discussion in the book.</p><p>

Deleting a Singleton class/instance is a non-trivial design problem.
See "To kill a Singleton" by John Vlissides (<cite>C++ Report</cite>,
Jun 96, pp10-19) for a discussion.


</p><h3>Structure</h3>

</center>

Make the class of the single instance responsible for access and
"initialization on first use".  The single instance is a private
static attribute. The accessor function is a public static method.

<h3>Example</h3>

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and
provides a global point of access to that instance.  It is named after
the singleton set, which is defined to be a set containing one
element.  The office of the President of the United States is a
Singleton.  The United States Constitution specifies the means by which
a president is elected, limits the term of office, and defines the
order of succession.  As a result, there can be at most one active
president at any given time.  Regardless of the personal identity of
the active president, the title, "The President of the United States"
is a global point of access that identifies the person in the office.

patterns", <cite>Object Magazine</cite>, Jul 97, p54]<p>

<h3>Check list</h3>

<ol>
<li>Define a private <code>static</code> attribute in the "single
instance" class.
</li><li>Define a public <code>static</code> accessor function in the class.
</li><li>Do "lazy initialization" (creation on first use) in the
accessor function.
</li><li>Define all constructors to be <code>protected</code> or
<code>private</code>.
</li><li>Clients may only use the accessor function to manipulate
the Singleton.
</li></ol>

<h3>Rules of thumb</h3>

Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype can use Singleton in their
implementation. [GoF, p134]<p>

Facade objects are often Singletons because only one Facade object is
required. [GoF, p193]</p><p>

State objects are often Singletons. [GoF, p313]</p><p>

It's relatively easy to protect Singleton against multiple
instantiations because there is good language support in this
area.  The most complicated problem is managing a Singleton's
lifetime, especially its destruction ... There are serious
threading issues surrounding the pattern. [Alexandrescu, p155]
&nbsp; For C++ lifetime issues, see Alexandrescu, pp133-145.
&nbsp; For C++ multi-threaded implementation, see Alexandrescu,
pp145-148. &nbsp; For Java multi-threaded implementation,
see Freeman, pp179-182. &nbsp; For subclassing the Singleton
instance, see Gamma, pp130-131.</p><p>

The advantage of Singleton over global variables is that you
are absolutely sure of the number of instances when you use
Singleton, and, you can change your mind and manage any number
of instances. [Ralph Johnson]</p><p>

The Singleton design pattern is one of the most inappropriately
used patterns.  Singletons are intended to be used when a class
must have exactly one instance, no more, no less ... [Designers]
frequently use Singletons in a misguided attempt to replace
global variables ... A Singleton is, for intents and purposes,
a global variable.  The Singleton does not do away with the
global; it merely renames it. [Hyslop, p51]</p><p>

When is Singleton unnecessary? &nbsp; Short answer: most of the
time. &nbsp; Long answer: when it's simpler to pass an object
resource as a reference to the objects that need it, rather than
letting objects access the resource globally ... The real problem
with Singletons is that they give you such a good excuse not to
think carefully about the appropriate visibility of an object.
&nbsp; Finding the right balance of exposure and protection for
an object is critical for maintaining flexibility. [Kerievsky,
pp115-116]</p><p>

Our group had a bad habit of using global data, so I did a study
group on Singleton. &nbsp; The next thing I know Singletons
appeared everywhere and none of the problems related to global
data went away. &nbsp; The answer to the global data question
is not, "Make it a Singleton." &nbsp; The answer is, "Why in the
hell are you using global data?" &nbsp; Changing the name doesn't
change the problem. &nbsp; In fact, it may make it worse because
it gives you the opportunity to say, "Well I'm not doing that,
I'm doing this&#8221; &#8211; even though this and that are the same thing.
